models:
  - name: ga4_first_click_attribution_model.sql
    description: |
      This model calculates first-click attribution for GA4 sessions. It generates conversion paths for user sessions leading up to an order (or key conversion) event and applies a first-click attribution model within defined lookback windows.
      First-click attribution assigns full credit for the conversion to the first touchpoint (e.g., the first ad or website visit) in the user's conversion journey that leads to the conversion.
