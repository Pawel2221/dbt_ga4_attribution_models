models:
  - name: ga4_last_click_non_direct_attribution_model.sql
    description: |
      This model calculates last-click non-direct attribution for GA4 sessions. It generates conversion paths for user sessions leading up to an order (or key conversion) event and applies a last-click non-direct attribution model within defined lookback windows.
      Last-click non-direct attribution assigns full credit for the conversion to the last non-direct touchpoint (e.g., the last ad or website visit that wasn't direct) in the user's conversion journey that leads to the conversion. If no non-direct touchpoints are present, the last direct touchpoint receives the credit.
