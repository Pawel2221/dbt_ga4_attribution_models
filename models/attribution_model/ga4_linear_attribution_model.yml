models:
  - name: linear_attribution_model.sql
    description: |
      This model calculates linear attribution for GA4 sessions. It generates conversion paths for user sessions leading up to an order (or key conversion) event and applies a linear attribution model within defined lookback windows.
      Linear attribution assigns equal credit for the conversion to all touchpoints in the user's conversion journey that lead to the conversion. This approach distributes the attribution weight evenly across all interactions.
    columns:
      - name: order_surrogate_key
        description: Unique surrogate key for each order, generated from `session_id` and `order_timestamp`.
      - name: user_pseudo_id
        description: A unique user identifier (`client_id`) automatically generated to identify users.
      - name: order_timestamp
        description: Timestamp of the order event.
      - name: order_date
        description: Date of the order event.
      - name: lookback_window
        description: Lookback window duration (in days) used to capture touchpoints prior to the order. The values are either 30 days or 365 days before the order or key conversion occurred.
      - name: conv_path
        description: Array of structs containing the sequence of touchpoints, including timestamp, UTM source, medium, and campaign, within the defined lookback window before the order or key conversion event.
      - name: attribution_model
        description: Specifies the attribution model applied. In this case, it is the 'linear' attribution model.
      - name: touchpoint_timestamp
        description: Timestamp of the session (touchpoint) start.
      - name: path_length
        description: The number of touchpoints within the defined lookback window that are considered for attribution.
      - name: attributed_weight
        description: The fraction of the conversion credit assigned to each touchpoint within the conversion path. This value is evenly distributed among all touchpoints (1 divided by the number of touchpoints).
      - name: utm_source
        description: The UTM source from the session (touchpoint).
      - name: utm_medium
        description: The UTM medium from the session (touchpoint).
      - name: utm_campaign
        description: The UTM campaign from the session (touchpoint).
